# Blogplatform-project-work
So this project is something I have been doing for school as an assignment. It's a simple website with a web 2.0 feeling, so it might feel like an app.
The site is builded with PHP as backend and jQuery as frontend. This is because it's the course we are learning.

I'm having three different ajax calls; One for creating account, one for logging
Unfortunately, I am not a good designer, so it looks quite bad. But it works fine, and does it work.
